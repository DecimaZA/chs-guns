ReactRouter v6 handles navigation.
MUI v5 handles all styling in respect of the Header and Footer, as well as general page layouts.
- MUI succeeded Material-UI by mere months when I started the CHS project. 
eCommerce is handled by Open Commerce.
- Open Commerce succeeded Reaction Commerce (implementation postponed to later date).
