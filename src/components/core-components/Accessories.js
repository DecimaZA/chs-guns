                We of course stock many options to spruce up your firearm with aftermarket components, such as front and rear 
                sight options, weapon light attachments, carbine-pistol conversion kits, non-OEM internal components, and the 
                all-important soft or hard-body carry cases for your rifles, pistols, and shotguns. 
                We also stock non-firearm accessories such as tactical flashlights, pepper sprays, telescopic batons, 
                tonfas, and more!
