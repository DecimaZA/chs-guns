            <p>
            We can issue ‘gunsmith reports’ to verify firearm specific information for the purposes of the SAPS and licensing, 
            source various spares within reason and availability (we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in finding a part for 
            firearms that may have been discontinued in the 1940s for example, but we may be able to point you in the right direction), 
            as well as general advice you may have regarding the competency and licensing process. 
            Please click HERE to see details regarding our storage solutions. 
            We also offer short term storage solutions, as well as long term. If you intend to spend an extended period of time overseas, 
            we recommend dealer stocking your firearm with us should you decide not to return to South Africa. Doing so will also eliminate 
            the risk of your license expiring and being caught in that nasty trap. 
            Please note that any firearms left in our care with unpaid storage bills after six months may be sold or surrendered to the 
            SAPS for destruction. We will send monthly invoices for storage fees in arrears, but please make sure that your account is up 
            to date. It pains us to make provision for this, but many firearm owners abandon their firearms in storage with no intention 
            to ever pay their bills or collect their firearms.
